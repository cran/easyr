\title{Characters to Factors}
\usage{
char2fac(x, sortlevels = FALSE, na_level = "(Missing)")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Data frame (or tibble) to modify.}

\item{sortlevels}{Choose whether to sort levels. This is the default R behavior and is therefore likely faster, but it may change the order of the data and this can be problematic so the default is FALSE.}

\item{na_level}{dplyr doesn't like factors to have NAs so we replace NAs with this value for factors only. Set NULL to skip.}
}
\value{
Data frame (or tibble) with converted factors.
}
\description{
Convert all character columns in a data frame to factors.
