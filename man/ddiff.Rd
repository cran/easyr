ddiff(x, y, unit = "day", do.date.convert = TRUE, do.numeric = TRUE)

\item{y}{Vector of ending dates or items that can be converted to dates by todate.}

\item{unit}{Character indicating what to use as the unit of difference. Values like d, y, m or day, year, month will work. Takes just the first letter in lower-case to determine unit.}

\item{do.date.convert}{Convert to dates before running the difference. If you know your columns are already dates, setting to FALSE will make your code run faster.}
